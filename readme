SYNOPSIS
    ./myshell
    ./myshell [batchfile]

DESCRIPTION
    Operation
        Once downloaded, run the "make" command to compile the shell. 
        
        To run the shell with line-by-line input, enter "./myshell" in the directory where the make 
        created the compiled file "myshell". 

        To run the shell with a batchfile, enter "./myshell [batchfile]". The shell will terminate 
        once the batchfile has reached the end-of-file (EOF).
    
    Commands
        Below is a list of every command the shell accepts and their usage.

        cd
            Usage:
                cd
                cd [directory]
            
            Description:
                Changes the working directory to the specified one. Works with quotation marks (ex. 
                cd "Lab 2"). To specify an absolute path, the directory must begin with '/'. If a 
                directory is not given, the shell reports the current working directory.
        
        clr
            Usage:
                clr
            
            Description:
                Clears the terminal.
        
        dir
            Usage:
                dir
                dir > [outputfile]
                dir >> [outputfile]
                dir [directory]
                dir [directory] > [outputfile]
                dir [directory] >> [outputfile]
            
            Description:
                Lists all files and directories in the specified directory. Does not search 
                recursively. Works with quotation marks (ex. dir "Lab 2"). To specify an absolute 
                path, the directory must begin with '/'. If a directory is not given, the shell 
                reports the files in the current working directory. The output can be redirected 
                using '>' to overwrite the specified file, or '>>' to append to the specified file.
        
        environ
            Usage:
                environ
                environ > [outputfile]
                environ >> [outputfile]
            
            Description:
                Lists all the environment variables for the current user. The output can be 
                redirected using '>' to overwrite the specified file, or '>>' to append to the 
                specified file.
        
        echo
            Usage:
                echo
                echo > [outputfile]
                echo >> [outputfile]
                echo [comment]
                echo [comment] > [outputfile]
                echo [comment] >> [outputfile]
            
            Description:
                Displays the entered comment. Does not preserve the whitespace of the original 
                comment. If no comment is provided, displays a newline. The output can be 
                redirected using '>' to overwrite the specified file, or '>>' to append to the 
                specified file.
        
        help
            Usage:
                help
                help > [outputfile]
                help >> [outputfile]

            Description:
                Displays the contents of this file, using the "more" filter. The output can be 
                redirected using '>' to overwrite the specified file, or '>>' to append to the 
                specified file.
        
        pause
            Usage:
                pause
            
            Description:
                Pauses the shell until 'Enter' is pressed. Does not pause child processes.
        quit
            Usage:
                quit
            
            Description:
                Terminates and exits the shell.
        perm
            Usage:
                perm [octal code] [filename]
            
            Description:
                Changes the permissions of the specified file based on the entered octal code (ex. 
                using code 700 will set all permissions for users and no permissions for groups or 
                others).

    Program Invocation
        If the input does not match any of the shell commands (internal or external), the shell 
        assumes the input as program invocation. If the file is not found, the shell will return an 
        error and continue asking for input. The shell assumes the following format when a program 
        is invoked:

        [filename] [arg1] [arg2] ... [argn] < [input] > [output]

        Note that the file name does NOT need to be proceeded with "./", the shell will execute the 
        program regardless if it is present or not. Also note that one or both of the i/o 
        redirection operators are not required, as described below in "I/O Redirection".

    Environment
        The shell automatically adapts to any directory. An environment variable named "shell" is 
        created and added to the environment variables list automatically when the shell is run 
        (regardless if it was run normally or through a batchfile). Additionally, a second 
        environment variable named "parent" is added to the environment variables list by the child 
        process created by program invocation. This variable ONLY exists within the child and as 
        such cannot be accessed by the parent. This allows the shell to handle external commands 
        such as "ls -l" as expected.

    I/O Redirection
        Internal commands 'dir', 'environ', 'echo', and 'help' support output redirection using '>' 
        (to overwrite) or '>>' (to append) followed by a filename.

        If a program is invoked, both input ('<') and output ('>', '>>') operators may be used, in 
        any order. If one or both of the i/o streams are not included, or return an error, the 
        shell will default to stdin / stdout for the offending stream (ex. if the output stream is 
        missing, the shell defaults to stdout). The shell assumes that the arguments and operators 
        are delimited by a single space. Sample inputs below.

            echo hello there > [outputfile]
            [programname] < [inputfile]
            [programname] > [outputfile]
            [programname] [arg1] [arg2] < [inputfile] > [outputfile]

    Background Execution
        If the shell finds an '&' as the final argument of the input, it will run the command in 
        the background. The shell will confirm this and display a message using stdout to confirm 
        the process is in the background. The shell immediately accepts input once again when a 
        command is run in the background. Note this only works when running a program or using 
        external commands. Internal commands do not support background execution. Sample inputs 
        below.

            [programname] < [inputfile] &
            [programname] < [inputfile] > [outputfile] &
